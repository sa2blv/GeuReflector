# Messaging & Notification Ideas

This document collects ideas for consuming GeuReflector MQTT events and
delivering them to operators, sysadmins, and radio communities through
external messaging channels.

The common pattern: a lightweight bridge subscribes to MQTT topics and
forwards filtered events to one or more destinations.

---

## 1. Telegram Bot

**What:** A bot in a Telegram group or channel posts activity updates.

**Useful events:**
- Talker start/stop — "IW1GEU is talking on TG 22250"
- Client connect/disconnect — "Node ON4ABC joined the reflector"
- Trunk link up/down — alerts when a peer reflector goes offline
- Periodic activity summary — daily digest of unique callsigns and TG usage

**Implementation:** A Python script using `paho-mqtt` + `python-telegram-bot`.
Subscribe to `svxreflector/+/talker/#` and `svxreflector/+/trunk/#`, format
messages, and post to a chat ID. Use Telegram's silent messages for
high-frequency events (talker) and normal notifications for alerts (trunk down).

**Filtering ideas:**
- Only notify for specific TGs (e.g. your local repeater's TG)
- Suppress repeated talker events within N seconds (debounce)
- Only notify trunk down events that persist beyond a grace period
- Mute overnight (configurable quiet hours)

## 2. SMS / Signal / WhatsApp Alerts

**What:** Critical alerts sent via SMS or secure messaging for on-call sysadmins.

**Useful events:**
- Trunk link down (all directions) — the mesh is degraded
- All clients disconnected — possible reflector issue
- No heartbeat / status missing for extended period

**Implementation:**
- SMS via Twilio, Vonage, or a local GSM modem (e.g. Gammu)
- Signal via `signal-cli`
- WhatsApp via WhatsApp Business API

Keep these strictly low-volume — only actionable alerts that need immediate
attention. Apply a cooldown (e.g. max 1 SMS per trunk link per 30 minutes).

## 3. Discord Integration

**What:** A Discord bot or webhook posts to a channel in your radio club's
Discord server.

**Useful events:**
- Talker activity with TG name mapping — "IW1GEU talking on Liguria (22250)"
- Node online/offline with QTH info — "ON4ABC online from Genova [44.41, 8.93]"
- RX signal levels — embed with colored indicators (green/yellow/red)

**Implementation:** Discord webhooks are the simplest — just POST a JSON
payload. For richer interaction (slash commands to query status), use a bot
with `discord.py`. Embed formatting works well for structured radio data.

---

## 4. Email Digests

**What:** Periodic email summaries rather than real-time notifications.

**Content ideas:**
- Daily activity report: unique callsigns, total TX time per TG, peak hours
- Weekly trunk health: uptime percentages, reconnection counts
- Monthly statistics: most active nodes, TG usage trends

**Implementation:** A cron job or MQTT consumer that accumulates events in a
local database (SQLite), then formats and sends an HTML email via SMTP.
Useful for club newsletters or repeater coordinator reports.

---

## 5. Web Dashboard via WebSocket Bridge

**What:** An MQTT-to-WebSocket bridge so browser-based dashboards get
real-time push updates without polling the HTTP `/status` endpoint.

**Implementation options:**
- **Mosquitto WebSocket listener** — Mosquitto natively supports WebSocket
  on a separate port. Browsers connect directly with an MQTT.js client.
- **Dedicated bridge** — a small Node.js or Python service subscribes to
  MQTT and relays to WebSocket clients, adding filtering/auth.

This is the natural backend for `SvxReflectorDashboard` or any custom
dashboard — subscribe to `client/+/rx` for live signal meters, `talker/#`
for activity indicators, and `status` for the full state on connect.

---

## 6. Webhook Relay (Generic)

**What:** Forward MQTT events as HTTP POST webhooks to any service.

**Targets:**
- Home Assistant — automate a "repeater active" indicator light
- Node-RED — visual flow-based processing and routing
- IFTTT / Zapier — connect to hundreds of services without code
- Custom REST APIs — feed events into your own logging or monitoring stack

**Implementation:** A generic MQTT-to-webhook bridge with a config file
mapping topic patterns to URLs and optional payload transforms. Several
open-source projects already do this (e.g. `mqttwarn`).

---

## 7. Push Notifications (Mobile)

**What:** Native push notifications on Android/iOS.

**Options:**
- **Pushover** — simple API, supports priority levels and quiet hours,
  per-device/group targeting. Ideal for ham radio use.
- **ntfy.sh** — self-hostable, no account needed, supports topic-based
  subscriptions
- **Firebase Cloud Messaging** — if building a dedicated mobile app

**Filtering:** Essential for mobile — only push trunk alerts and talker
events on subscribed TGs. Let users configure which TGs they care about.

---

## 8. Logging & Monitoring

**What:** Feed events into observability infrastructure.

**Targets:**
- **InfluxDB + Grafana** — time-series dashboards for signal levels, TX
  duration, trunk latency, node uptime
- **Elasticsearch + Kibana** — searchable event log, useful for debugging
  intermittent issues
- **Prometheus** — expose MQTT-derived metrics via an exporter; alert on
  trunk down, node count drop, etc.

**Value:** Historical data enables trend analysis — which TGs are growing,
which nodes have flaky connections, what time of day is busiest.

## Architecture Pattern

All of these follow the same decoupled pattern:

```
GeuReflector
    |
    | MQTT publish
    v
MQTT Broker (Mosquitto)
    |
    |--- Telegram bridge
    |--- SMS alerter
    |--- Discord webhook
    |--- WebSocket bridge --> Browser dashboard
    |--- mqttwarn --> Webhooks, email, push
    |--- InfluxDB writer --> Grafana
```

The reflector only speaks MQTT. Each consumer is independent, can be added
or removed without touching the reflector, and can run anywhere with network
access to the broker. Multiple consumers can subscribe to the same topics
simultaneously.

## Getting Started

The simplest starting point is a Telegram bot with `mqttwarn` or a short
Python script:

```bash
pip install paho-mqtt python-telegram-bot
```

```python
import paho.mqtt.client as mqtt
import telegram
import json

bot = telegram.Bot(token="YOUR_BOT_TOKEN")
CHAT_ID = "YOUR_CHAT_ID"

def on_message(client, userdata, msg):
    data = json.loads(msg.payload)
    tg = msg.topic.split("/")[-2]
    if msg.topic.endswith("/start"):
        bot.send_message(CHAT_ID,
            f"📡 {data['callsign']} talking on TG {tg}")
    elif msg.topic.endswith("/stop") and "duration_ms" in data:
        # Skip kerchunks under 1 s; pretty-print the rest.
        if data["duration_ms"] >= 1000:
            secs = data["duration_ms"] / 1000
            bot.send_message(CHAT_ID,
                f"🔇 {data['callsign']} stopped on TG {tg} "
                f"({secs:.1f} s)")

client = mqtt.Client()
client.username_pw_set("user", "pass")
client.on_message = on_message
client.connect("mqtt.example.com", 1883)
client.subscribe("svxreflector/+/talker/#")
client.loop_forever()
```

The `start` and `stop` payloads carry `ts` (Unix epoch ms) and `stop`
additionally carries `duration_ms` when a matching start was observed —
see [`docs/MQTT.md`](MQTT.md) for the schema and edge cases. Filtering
on `duration_ms < 1000` is a cheap way to suppress kerchunks; using
`ts` lets you compute end-to-end latency between the reflector and
your bot pipeline.
